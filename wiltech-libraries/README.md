# WilTech libraries


To create libraries follow this tutorial
`https://angular.dev/tools/libraries/creating-libraries`

For more details you see this tutorial here `https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/share-angular-components-across-projects?ref=dailydev`


* Create a workspace `ng new wiltech-libraries --no-create-application`
* Create a library `ng generate library user-store`

The command above will create a workspace called `eiltech-libraries` followed by a library called `user-store` inside the projects folder

To create components within the each library, then navigate to the root of the library Eg `cd projects` and `cd user-store`
