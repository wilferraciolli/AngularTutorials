Sample code for the ["RxJS and Angular Signal Fundamentals" course at Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rxjs-angular-signals-fundamentals)

Using RxJS and signals with reactive programming techniques, our applications are more responsive to user actions and state changes, providing a better user experience with less code.

In this course, we learn the fundamentals of RxJS and signals. And how they are powerful together, improving our state management and reactivity.

Some of the major topics that we cover include: 
 
1.	Demystifying RxJS, breaking down its terms, syntax, and operators
2.	Harnessing the power of Subjects to react effectively to user actions
3.	Leveraging signals for easier state management and improved change detection
4.	And using RxJS and Signals together, to get the best from both
 
By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge to better manage state and build more reactive Angular applications using RxJS and signals.

I hope you’ll join me on this exciting journey to learn RxJS and signals with the "RxJS and Angular Signals Fundamentals" course, at Pluralsight.
